<h2>Best 4 Line Phone System For Small Business in Moraga California</h2>
<p>Cloud-based phone systems are not tied to a single geographic area like traditional phones are, which makes it hard to precisely trace a 911 call. In fact, you must be able to forward phone calls that enter your business' primary telephone number to any linked smart phone.
