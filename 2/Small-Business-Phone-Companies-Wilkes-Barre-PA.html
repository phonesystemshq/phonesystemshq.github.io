<p>Voice communication is an essential decision for any business, whether small or enterprise. Hybrid Phone Systems work over both the standard copper phone network or the internet. Lastly, the organization would require VoIP-specific network infrastructures, such as media gateways and session border controllers (SBCs ). In general, lowering costs can be a strong use case for VoIP but only if the switch is made with these factors in mind. Cordless phones enable users to move easily around their workspace while on a call.</p>
<p>The key difference in between PBX and VoIP is that in case of a power blackout, and no internet, a PBX phone system generally has an uninterruptible power supply, and uses the general public switched telephone network (PSTN). From small business VoIP providers to business VoIP phone systems, every business phone service has a various list of feature sets, and rates. Calls between VoIP and the analogue network are enabled by equipment (such as Media Gateways) creating connections in between them.</p>

At ServiceMark, we are strong proponents of hosted, cloud based telephone system solutions. VoIP, also referred to as an internet phone system, transforms the noise of your voice into a digital signal that can be sent over the internet much like any other data.
