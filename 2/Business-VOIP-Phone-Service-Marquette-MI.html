<p>Much of the development and excitement for IP PBX and surrounding services is produced by the mid-sized Canadian IP PBX suppliers and provider (RingCentral, Versature and Telehop for instances) that remain in growth mode. More than 9 out of 10 services suggest Nextiva on GetVoIP, which's from over 1,300 reviews.
