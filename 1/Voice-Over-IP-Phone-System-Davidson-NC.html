While Digital Phone Systems are practical and convenient; they're not mobile. However, if your business should adhere to security guidelines that require information to be stored on-site, then a hosted service is most likely not the best solution. The only distinction between Centrex and today's hosted phone systems (besides the lower cost these days's hosted systems) is that the Centrex systems ran over the conventional phone networks (the conventional phone lines) instead of the Internet (as holds true with a hosted VoIP system today).</p>
