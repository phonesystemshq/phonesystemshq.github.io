<p>VoIP phone service has been around for some time as services and business owners switch from telephone services that utilize PSTN (Public Changed Telephone Network) to a more advanced system. There is a substantial range of VoIP providers on the internet which provide SIP trunking (telephone systems services) for less expensive call rates than traditional telephone providers. The hardware and software is affordable, too, for VoIP phone systems. In addition, wireless "hot spots" in places such as parks, airports, and coffee shops permit you to link to the Internet and may allow you to use VoIP service wirelessly.</p>
